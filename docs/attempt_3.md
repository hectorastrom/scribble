## Third attempt: Using timeseries representations
Still in progress, and will update as I go on.

You can view the scripts related to this attempt at `src.ml.architectures.lstm`,
`src.ml.pretrain`.

Currently, LSTM pretraining on my own ~970 mouse samples does not exceed a test
accuracy of 0.16. I suspect there's some bug.
